# Recently Files Tree

[English Intro](README.md) | [中文介绍](README-ZH.md)

VS Code's built-in recent files list is sorted based on the order in which files were opened. This extension, however, unfolds recent files based on directory structure, making it easier to locate files.

## Features

- **Sorts files by path**: Organizes files according to their directory structure.
- **Supports bookmarking**: Allows you to add files to a favorites list for quick access.
- **Supports filtering**: Provides options to filter files based on specific criteria.

## Comparison

VS Code default recent files:

- **Unorganized and chaotic**
